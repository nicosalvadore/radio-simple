# PHP Web Panel

A simple, containerized PHP web application designed to act as a control panel.

## Overview

This project provides a basic web interface built with PHP, HTML, and JavaScript. It is set up to run easily in a local development environment using Docker. The current `docker-compose.yml` configuration uses the official `php:apache` image to serve the application.

## Features

- **Radio Station Grid**: Displays a grid of radio stations fetched from a local data source.
- **Audio Streaming**: Click on any station's logo to play its live audio stream.
- **Player Controls**: A persistent player at the bottom of the page provides play/pause and volume control.
- **Dynamic Content**: The list of radio stations is dynamically generated by reading from `database.csv`.

## Database

The application uses a simple flat-file approach for its data, storing radio station information in `database.csv`.

Each row in the CSV represents one radio station and follows this structure:

`id,station_name,stream_url,image_filename`

To add, remove, or modify radio stations, you can directly edit the `database.csv` file. Make sure any new image files are placed in the `/images` directory.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
